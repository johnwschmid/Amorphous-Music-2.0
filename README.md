Amorphous Music

This is a music blog I created as a sample application to showcase my ability to utilize fullstack development to create a fully-functional rails app with: solid mvc architecture, RESTful routing, database integration, user authentication, mailing capability.
  
In progress: API integration, utilization of rails 5's reactJS modules and deployment via AWS.
  
Too much more functionality and it would very much surpass being a simple music blog. See resume and other github repo's for more info.
